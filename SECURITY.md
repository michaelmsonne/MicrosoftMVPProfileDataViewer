# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repositories, please report it to me as described below. I take the security of my software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through my GitHub.

## How to Report

### GitHub Security Advisory

1. Navigate to the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/michaelmsonne/TEMPLATE/security/advisories/new).
2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.
3. I will try to fix it and publish an update ASAP!

2. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.
3. I will try to fix it and publish an update ASAP!
